# notion-webclipper-as-todo-list

This is a tweaked way to store todo list using Notion Web Clipper.

## Context

We have already seen how Notion Web Clipper is used to store Reading List. This modifies that same logic to store todos.

Notion Web Clipper saves url and title of the web page. This page has a text area where you can type your todo and that todo is 2 way binded to the title of the page. Now when you click on the Notion Web Clipper you can save the typed todo into your todos list


### Note

* This works only on Web, since Notion web clipper works only on Web.
